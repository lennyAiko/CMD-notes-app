COMMAND LINE NOTES APP

This is a notes app that is only used on the command line, the notes are stores in the memory only for as long as the program is running, i.e once the program stops, all data is lost.

First tip: Commands are chosen with alphabets not symbols, the designated alphabet for each operation is parenthesized in front of it.

Second tip: It is a multiline notes app, so feel free to press enter to go to the next line. Once you are done typing, press 'ctrl + s' to save and then 'ctrl + q' to quit the typing mode.

NB: install the module in the requirements.txt file.
